You are given a string s. You have to find the length of the longest substring with all distinct characters. 

Examples:

Input: s = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 7
Explanation: "eksforg" is the longest substring with all distinct characters.
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 1
Explanation: "a" is the longest substring with all distinct characters.
Input: s = "abcdefabcbb"
Output: 6
Explanation: The longest substring with all distinct characters is "abcdef", which has a length of 6.
Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 105
s consists of lowercase english letters.

SOLUTION:



// User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    public int longestUniqueSubstr(String s) {
        // code here
        HashSet<Character>set=new HashSet<>();
        int max_length=0;
        int left=0;
        for(int right=0;right<s.length();right++){
            while(set.contains(s.charAt(right))){
                set.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
            set.add(s.charAt(right));
            max_length=Math.max(max_length,(right-left)+1);
        }
        return max_length;
    }
}
